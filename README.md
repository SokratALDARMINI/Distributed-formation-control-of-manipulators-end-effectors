# Distributed-formation-control-of-manipulators-end-effectors
In this work we simulate the conroller propused by [1], which provides a distributed formation control of manipulators' end-effectors with internal model-based disturbance rejection. The formation control objective is achieved by assigning virtual springs between end-effectors, by adding damping terms at joints, and by incorporating internal model-based dynamic compensators to counteract the effect of the disturbances.

The simulation results match with the results shown in the related work.
